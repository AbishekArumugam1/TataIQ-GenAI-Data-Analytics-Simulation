# Tata iQ - Data Analytics & AI Job Simulation

This repository contains my completed work from the **Tata iQ Data Analytics Job Simulation** offered by Tata Group via Forage.

## 📘 Overview
The project simulates a real-world data analytics and AI role where I helped **Geldium**, a financial client, design a predictive AI-powered collections system.

## 🧩 Tasks

### Task 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned and analyzed the dataset using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Identified correlations between credit score, income, and default risk

### Task 2 – Predictive Modeling
- Built a Logistic Regression model to predict loan delinquency
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### Task 3 – Stakeholder Communication
- Translated technical insights into actionable business recommendations
- Created a report for Geldium’s Head of Collections

### Task 4 – AI-Powered Collections System
- Proposed an AI-driven automation framework
- Highlighted ethical AI principles: transparency, fairness, and accountability

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PowerPoint / MS Word
